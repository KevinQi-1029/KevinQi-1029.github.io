I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the [Pattern Recognition Laboratory](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/xygk/zzjg/jcxszz/401dc4db5410423db49a077b2c838592.htm) of [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), specializing in 3D computer vision. I completed my undergraduate studies at [the School of Automation](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/xygk/xyjj/index.htm), Beijing Institute of Technology. My primary research areas include 3D Gaussian Splatting, Neural Radiance Fields, and 3D scene understanding.
